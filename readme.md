## üìä Ranking Systems & Player Analytics

- **TrueSkill‚Ñ¢ Rankings**
  - Official Offsuit Poker League ranking system using Microsoft's unbiased Bayesian algorithm
  - Same system used for Xbox Live competitive videogame matchmaking
  - Accurately measures and adapts to player skill levels
  - Specifically tuned for texas holdum tournaments

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Players Outlasted %: Average percentage of players outlasted per tournament
  - In The Money (ITM) %: Tournament cash out rate (approx top 15-20%)
  - ROI Analysis: How profitable of a tournament player you would be with typical tournament payouts 
  - First Place %: Tournament victories

## üéØ Technical Innovations & Achievements

- **Advanced Player Ranking**
  - Implemented and tuned Microsoft's TrueSkill‚Ñ¢ algorithm for poker tournaments
  - Accurate skill measurement for Texas Holdum no limit which has a large amount of luck

- **Security Infrastructure**
